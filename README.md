Simple procedural terrain with heightmap generation and water plane.

### Water Scene (`water-scene/`)
Advanced water rendering with reflections, refractions, and wave simulation.

### Sky & Volumetrics (`sky-volumetrics/`)
Procedural sky, clouds, and volumetric effects like god rays and fog.

### Vegetation Showcase (`vegetation-showcase/`)
Instanced vegetation with wind animation, LOD, and biome distribution.

### API Showcase (`api-showcase/`)
Comprehensive examples of the Strata API for all major systems.

## Getting Started

cd examples

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run an example
pnpm dev:terrain    # Basic terrain
pnpm dev:water      # Water scene
pnpm dev:sky        # Sky & volumetrics
pnpm dev:vegetation # Vegetation showcase
pnpm dev:api        # API showcase
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm 8+
- Modern browser with WebGL2 support

## Dependencies

All examples depend on the published `@jbcom/strata` npm package.

## CI/CD

This repository uses GitHub Actions to verify that all examples build correctly with the latest version of `@jbcom/strata`.

The verification runs:
- On every push to `main`
- On every pull request
- Weekly to check for breaking changes in `@jbcom/strata`

### Live Deployment
Successfully merged PRs to `main` are automatically deployed to GitHub Pages.

### Visual Regression Tests (Planned)
Future updates will include automated visual regression tests using Playwright/E2E to ensure visual consistency across strata versions.
